#866. Prime Palindrome
Alt-H1
======

```
Find the smallest prime palindrome greater than or equal to N.

Recall that a number is prime if it's only divisors are 1 and itself,
and it is greater than 1. helel

For example, 2,3,5,7,11 and 13 are primes.

Recall that a number is a palindrome if it reads the same from left
to right as it does from right to left.

For example, 12321 is a palindrome.

##Using I.D.E.A.L

I.D.E.A.L helped me in solving this problem by focusing on the identification
of the problem. I had a difficult time in determining just what the question
was asking because I was confused as to what a "prime palindrome" was, so
the identification/definition of the problem was very helpful. I explored
solutions by trying to come up with them on paper and by tracing sets of
input/output before I tried coding them. With every coding attempt, I looked
back to the problem definition and evaluated if the results were what was asked
for in the problem definition.

##Using Duke's Seven Steps

Duke's Seven Steps was helpful in analyzing this problem because I started working
with small instances by hand, in this case, I tried out different input values
of a small size to understand what the question was asking for. I also looked for
patterns in the palindrome combinations. For example, "12321" and "123321." Something
I did before writing code is to come up with test cases, which I then was able to
perform on my program.
