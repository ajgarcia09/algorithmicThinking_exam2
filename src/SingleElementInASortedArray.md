# 540. Single Element in a Sorted Array

https://leetcode.com/problems/word-subsets/

```
Given a sorted array consisting of only integers where every element
appears twice except for one element which appears once.
Find this single element that appears only once.
```

## Using I.D.E.A.L.
I used I.D.E.A.L. to *identify* what the problem was asking, which is finding the
only element that is not repeated in the sorted input array. The solution that I
*explored* was to iterate through the array comparing odd indexes with even
indexes and if they were the same, I moved on until I found numbers that wre not
the same. After looking at my results, I *looked back* to the problem statement
and made sure that I met the run time requirements and that my all of
my test cases passed.


## Using Duke's Seven Steps
For this problem, I found that I.D.E.A.L was sufficient for me to solve the problem,
so I didn't require to use any of Duke's steps.
